## 🎯 High-Risk Technical Requirements Assessment

### **1. Timer Accuracy Requirements**

#### **Requirement**: "±1 second precision, 99.9% accuracy over 8-hour sessions"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Achievable**: Yes, with proper implementation
- ⚠️ **Challenges**: System sleep/wake, thread timing, GUI updates
- 🔧 **Approach**: Use system time (time.time()) rather than cumulative timing

**Technical Evidence**:
```python
# Feasible approach - system time based
start_time = time.time()
elapsed = time.time() - start_time

# Problematic approach - cumulative timing
elapsed += 1  # Accumulates drift and errors
```

**Validation Strategy**:
- Build timer prototype and test over 8-hour period
- Test accuracy across system sleep/wake cycles
- Validate performance under system load

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **Medium** - Achievable but requires careful implementation

---

### **2. Cross-Platform System Tray Integration**

#### **Requirement**: "System Tray Integration - Minimize to system tray with fallback options"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Windows**: Fully supported with `pystray` or `tkinter` workarounds
- ⚠️ **macOS**: Limited support, behavior differs significantly
- ❌ **Linux**: Inconsistent support across desktop environments

**Technical Evidence**:
```python
# Windows - Reliable
import pystray
from PIL import Image

# macOS - Limited
# System tray exists but behavior differs from Windows

# Linux - Problematic
# GNOME removed system tray, KDE supports it, others vary
```

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Windows**: Full system tray implementation
2. **macOS**: Dock icon with right-click menu (native behavior)
3. **Linux**: Taskbar minimize with optional system tray where supported

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **Medium** - Requires platform-specific implementations

---

### **3. File Locking for Multi-Instance Prevention**

#### **Requirement**: "File Locking Mechanism - Prevent concurrent data access from multiple instances"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: `filelock` library provides reliable cross-platform locking
- ✅ **Implementation**: Well-established patterns available
- ⚠️ **Edge Cases**: Network drives, permissions, crashes

**Technical Evidence**:
```python
from filelock import FileLock

lock = FileLock("data.json.lock")
with lock:
    # Safe file operations
    pass
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- Test on network drives
- Test lock cleanup after crash
- Test permission scenarios

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **Low** - Well-understood, reliable libraries available

---

### **4. System Sleep/Wake Detection**

#### **Requirement**: "System Sleep/Wake Detection - Pause timers during system sleep, resume on wake"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Windows**: WMI events can detect power state changes
- ⚠️ **macOS**: Core Foundation APIs available but complex
- ⚠️ **Linux**: dbus signals available but varies by desktop environment

**Technical Evidence**:
```python
# Windows approach
import wmi
c = wmi.WMI()
for event in c.Win32_PowerManagementEvent():
    # Handle sleep/wake events
    pass

# Cross-platform alternative: detect time jumps
last_check = time.time()
current_time = time.time()
if current_time - last_check > 60:  # Likely resumed from sleep
    handle_wake_event()
```

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Primary**: Time-jump detection (works on all platforms)
2. **Enhanced**: Platform-specific APIs where available
3. **Fallback**: User manual resume option

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **Medium** - Time-jump detection is reliable fallback

---

### **5. Memory Usage Targets**

#### **Requirement**: "<20MB when minimized, <50MB when active"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Basic Tkinter**: ~5-15MB baseline achievable
- ⚠️ **With Features**: Additional memory for data, themes, etc.
- ✅ **Target Achievable**: With careful memory management

**Technical Baseline**:
```python
# Minimal tkinter application memory usage
import tkinter as tk
import psutil
import os

root = tk.Tk()
process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
memory_mb = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
# Typical result: 8-12MB for basic tkinter app
```

**Memory Optimization Strategies**:
1. Lazy loading of UI components
2. Data structure optimization
3. Image/resource cleanup
4. Timer callback optimization

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **Low** - Targets are reasonable for Python/Tkinter

---

### **6. Startup Time Requirements**

#### **Requirement**: "Application starts in < 3 seconds on Windows 10 with 8GB RAM"

**Feasibility Analysis**:
- ✅ **Basic App**: <1 second easily achievable
- ⚠️ **With Features**: Data loading, UI setup adds time
- ✅ **Target Achievable**: With optimization

**Optimization Strategies**:
```python
# Fast startup techniques
1. Minimal imports at startup
2. Lazy loading of modules
3. Background initialization
4. Cached data structures
```

**Benchmark Targets**:
- Basic window: <500ms
- Data loading: <1000ms
- UI setup: <500ms
- Total: <2000ms (well under 3 seconds)

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **Low** - Very achievable target

import tempfile
import os

def atomic_write(filename, data):
    temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False)
    json.dump(data, temp_file)
    temp_file.close()
    os.replace(temp_file.name, filename)  # Atomic on most systems
```
