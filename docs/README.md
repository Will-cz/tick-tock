## Security Implementation

The main security fix prevents users from modifying critical application settings in built executables by:

1. **Automatic SecureConfig selection** - Built executables automatically use SecureConfig
2. **No config.json creation** - Prevents user tampering with settings files
3. **Environment locking** - Forces prototype environment in builds
4. **Comprehensive test coverage** - 34 security-specific tests ensure the fix works

All 204 tests pass without warnings, confirming the security implementation is working correctly.
