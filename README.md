- üìä **Primitive Project Management**: Basic project creation and editing
- üé® **Limited Theming**: Basic color theme cycling
- üìà **Basic Reporting**: Simple monthly time reports
- üíæ **JSON Data Storage**: File-based project data persistence
- ü™ü **Windows Desktop Widget**: Minimizable desktop application
- üîî **System Tray Integration**: Windows system tray support with hide/show functionality

### Legacy Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (Python standard library)
- **Data Storage**: JSON files
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Core: None (uses only Python standard library)
  - System Tray: pystray, Pillow (optional, graceful degradation)
