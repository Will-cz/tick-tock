## ⚠️ Critical Path Dependencies

### **Blocking Dependencies (High Risk)**

1. **GUI Framework Choice → Everything**
   - **Impact**: All UI features depend on this decision
   - **Risk**: Late change would require rewriting entire UI
   - **Recommendation**: Decide and validate in Week 1

2. **Data Storage Format → Data Features**
   - **Impact**: All data persistence features depend on JSON structure
   - **Risk**: Format changes later require migration system
   - **Recommendation**: Design complete data schema upfront

3. **Timer Architecture → All Timer Features**
   - **Impact**: Thread safety, accuracy, system integration all depend on core design
   - **Risk**: Poor design blocks advanced timer features
   - **Recommendation**: Prototype timer system early

### **Sequential Dependencies (Medium Risk)**

1. **Project CRUD → Project Selection → Timer Integration**
   - Cannot select projects without ability to create them
   - Cannot integrate timers without project selection

2. **Basic Reporting → Export Features → Advanced Reports**
   - Export depends on having something to export
   - Advanced reports build on basic reporting

3. **Error Handling → System Integration → Reliability Features**
   - System integration needs error handling
   - Reliability features need both

2. Basic Data Layer (JSON operations)
3. Core Error Handling
4. Font and DPI handling

Week 2:
1. Real-time Clock Display

## 🔄 Dependency Conflicts & Resolutions

### **Identified Conflicts**

1. **Real-time Updates vs Performance**
   - **Conflict**: 1-second updates vs minimal CPU usage
   - **Resolution**: Adaptive update frequency when minimized
   - **Dependencies**: Performance monitoring system

2. **Always On Top vs Unobtrusive**
   - **Conflict**: Visibility vs not interfering
   - **Resolution**: User-configurable with smart defaults
   - **Dependencies**: User preferences system

3. **Comprehensive Features vs Simplicity**
   - **Conflict**: Many features vs clean interface
   - **Resolution**: Progressive disclosure, minimized mode
   - **Dependencies**: UI state management

### **Dependency Loops (Circular Dependencies)**

1. **Timer System ↔ Project Management**
   - **Issue**: Timers need projects, projects need timer state
   - **Resolution**: Create timer interface that doesn't depend on specific projects
   - **Implementation**: Abstract timer → concrete project timer

2. **Data Layer ↔ Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Data operations need error handling, error handling needs data logging
   - **Resolution**: Layered error handling with simple file operations at base
   - **Implementation**: Basic file ops → error handling → advanced data ops

## 🎯 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **High-Risk Dependencies**
1. **GUI Framework Validation**
   - Create proof-of-concept for critical features
   - Validate system tray, always-on-top, transparency
   - Test cross-platform compatibility early

2. **Timer Accuracy Validation**
   - Build timer prototype and test accuracy
   - Test system sleep/wake behavior
   - Validate performance under load

3. **Data Integrity Validation**
   - Test file locking mechanisms
   - Validate atomic write operations
   - Test recovery from corruption

### **Contingency Plans**
1. **If GUI Framework Insufficient**
   - **Backup**: PyQt6 or customtkinter
   - **Impact**: 2-3 week delay
   - **Mitigation**: Early validation

2. **If Timer Accuracy Unachievable**
   - **Fallback**: ±5 second accuracy target
   - **Impact**: Reduced precision
   - **Mitigation**: Clear user communication

3. **If Performance Targets Missed**
   - **Adjustment**: Reduce feature scope
   - **Priority**: Maintain core functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement
